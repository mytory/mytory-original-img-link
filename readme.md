Mytory Original IMG Link
========================

My blog `img` `max-width` is `100%`. On wide screen, that's right. But on narrow screen, this is so small. So I made a plugin.

This plugin add link to original img below of all reduced img.

Logic
-----

1. If reduced ratio is below of 80%, add link to original image. Link show you original image is what times more large. And link has title attribute what percent of reducing.
2. If you resize browser, plugin recalcluate, and update text.
